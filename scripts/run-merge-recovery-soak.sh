# vanishes mid-step with no log and no failed step, which is exactly what
# happened to run 30590630059. Reserving 12GB caps nodes at 20GB, still ~2x

# restart window, an afternoon dispatch — can run for hours with nothing on the
# dashboard, and a 60h weekend run is dark for its first twelve. This makes a
# boundary reachable on demand. The signal file is written by the poller in the
# soak-segment action, which reads it from this instance's own OCI freeform
# tags; see .github/workflows/soak-signal.yml for the sender.
#
# Checked here rather than in the poller because only this loop knows where an
# iteration boundary is. Stopping mid-iteration would leave a half-finished
# iteration that the aggregator counts as a real one, skewing the very numbers
# the checkpoint exists to report.
#
#   checkpoint  End THIS segment now, so the caller's aggregate/upload/publish
#               steps run exactly as at a scheduled checkpoint. The next
#               segment resumes from the state file with counters, start time
#               and iteration numbering intact, and the run continues.
#
#               Only possible where a segment boundary exists. The caller gates
#               those publish steps on having passed a deadline, so in the
#               final segment the request is refused rather than silently
#               ending the run and publishing nothing -- which is what it would
#               do if this simply broke the loop. Zero-checkpoint runs are all
#               final segment, so that is the common case, not a corner.
#
#   finalize    End the run. The marker survives into the remaining segments,
#               which exit immediately, so the run drains to the normal
#               end-of-run publish and produces a real verdict and history
