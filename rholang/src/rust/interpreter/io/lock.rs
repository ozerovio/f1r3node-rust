// Range-lock module — data types (slice 1, prior PR) + state
// containers + registry skeleton (slice 2, this PR of the `lock`
// submodule tree).
//
// Prior slice (earlier Wave 2) provided the pure-data foundations:
//   - `DevInode` / `DeployScope` — identity + ownership tags.
//   - `LockId` / `HolderId` — newtype identifiers, with
//     `HolderId::ct_eq` for the constant-time release-path check.
//   - `LockMode` — read/write.
//   - `MAX_RANGES_PER_FILE` / `MAX_WAITERS_PER_FILE` /
//     `LOCK_ID_CEILING` — consensus-observable caps.
//   - `LockError` — the `FSERR_*` error taxonomy.
//   - `RangeEntry` — one granted range-lock record.
//
// This slice adds the state-container surface the acquire/release
// methods (yet-to-land) manipulate:
//   - `FileLockState { ranges, sequential_holder, waiters }` —
//     per-`(dev, inode)` state.
//   - `SequentialEntry` — a whole-file sequential lock record.
//   - `WaitPolicy` — Fail (MVP) vs. Wait (slice 8b opt-in).
//   - `AcquireOutcome { Immediate, Parked { lock_id, admit } }` —
//     the shape of the acquire-side return.
//   - `Waiter` (private) + `WaitKind` (private) — one parked
//     waiter entry.
//   - `LockRegistry { inner, next_lock_id }` + `new()` +
//     `mint_next_lock_id` — the empty skeleton.
//
// Acquire / release / wake / deadlock-detection logic (`range_
// conflicts` / `wake_waiters` / `would_close_cycle` / etc.) land
// in subsequent slices.  The data surface here lets a future
// slice land the acquire/release methods without re-touching the
// enum shapes or the struct fields.
//
// # Consensus surface
//
// Three constants register into `CONSENSUS_FOLD`:
//   - `MAX_RANGES_PER_FILE` (order 11) — per-`(dev, inode)` cap on
//     concurrent range locks; a divergent value fires
//     `FSERR_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` on different inputs across peers and
//     forks the tuplespace.
//   - `MAX_WAITERS_PER_FILE` (order 12) — per-`(dev, inode)` cap
//     on parked `wait: true` acquirers.  Same failure-mode
//     rationale.
//   - `LOCK_ID_CEILING` (order 13) — guard threshold on the LockId
//     monotone counter (wraps would collide new LockIds with
//     stale ones still in RSpace).
