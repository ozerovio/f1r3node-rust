/*
 * ARCHITECTURAL CHOICE: Trait-based Dependency Injection
 *
 * This implementation uses trait-based dependency injection instead of functional closures
 * because Rust's ownership model and async system work better with traits than with complex
 * closure captures. Traits provide zero-cost abstractions, better testability, and seamless
 * async support while maintaining the same flexibility as the original Scala version.
